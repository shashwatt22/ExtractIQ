"""RAG query interface: retrieve relevant chunks, then answer.

Answer synthesis has three tiers, tried in order:
  * field lookup — when the question is scoped to one document and matches
                   a well-known intent ("who are the parties", "total
                   amount due", ...), answer directly from that document's
                   already-extracted structured fields. Keyword-overlap
                   search over free text can match a sentence that merely
                   mentions the right word ("the parties agree as follows")
                   without naming anyone — the structured field is the
                   pipeline's actual, verified answer to that question.
  * "llm"        — when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set and the anthropic SDK is
                   installed, retrieved chunks are handed to an LLM that
                   answers strictly from the provided context.
  * "extractive" — otherwise, the most relevant sentence from the top
                   chunks is returned directly. Zero-dependency default.
